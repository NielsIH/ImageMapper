# SnapSpot PWA - Phase 1 Tasks: Infrastructure Setup

## Objective
Prepare all necessary module files with proper import/export syntax, without moving any functionality yet. Verify all files exist and the app continues to run as before.

## Tasks

### 1. Create Module Files
- [X] Create `js/app-map-interactions.js` with proper ES module structure and export functions for map interactions
- [X] Create `js/app-marker-photo-manager.js` with proper ES module structure and export functions for marker/photo management
- [X] Create `js/app-search.js` with proper ES module structure and export functions for search
- [X] Create `js/ui/upload-modal.js` with proper ES module structure and export functions for upload modal
- [X] Create `js/ui/settings-modal.js` with proper ES module structure and export functions for settings modal
- [X] Create `js/ui/marker-details-modal.js` with proper ES module structure and export functions for marker details modal

### 2. Verify Module Structure
- [X] Ensure each module has proper import/export syntax
- [X] Ensure each module exports the functions that will be moved in later phases
- [X] Verify all modules have correct file headers and comments

### 3. Verify App Continuity
- [X] Verify the app still runs without errors after creating new modules
- [X] Ensure no existing functionality is changed in this phase
- [X] Confirm all original files (app.js, modals.js) remain unchanged

### 4. Phase Completion Criteria
- [X] All 6 new module files exist with proper structure
- [X] All files have correct ES module syntax
- [X] App runs exactly as before with no errors
- [X] All modules have placeholder exports for planned functionality

## Expected Outcome
- 6 new module files created with proper structure
- App continues to work exactly as before
- Infrastructure ready for Phase 2 functionality moves
